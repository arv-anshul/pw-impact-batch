# PW Impact Batch - Hindi

This repo contains all the **assignments** present in the Impact batch. There is also some **quizzes** in the batch but it was embedded in the website.

## Additional Features ðŸ“Œ

### Automate the assignment folder creation ðŸ¤–

I created a [`python script`](./utils/assignment.py) to automate the downloading of the **pdf** file from the website and add to a new folder.

```python
from datetime import date
from utils import AssignmentFolder

f = AssignmentFolder(
    date=date(2023, 3, 25),
    url="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cRhT10uk6tFLe7GNF0YJJ3-U2J8vnsLp/view?usp=sharing",
    type="file"
)
f.make()
```

### Automate git commit shell command ðŸ¤–

I also created another [`python script`](./utils/commit_assignment.py) to **automate the git commands** to commit the **solved** assignment.

```bash
# Provide filename and commit message
python3 utils/commit_assignment.py --file-name February/07\ Feb --commit-message "Added 07 Feb assignment."
```

You can skip the commit message. _Only applicable for assignment files_.

```bash
python3 utils/commit_assignment.py --file-name February/07\ Feb

# NOTE: The default commit message is "Added <<file_name>> assignment."
```
